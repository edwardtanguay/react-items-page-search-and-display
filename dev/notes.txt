- x bug: bug:  Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.

- x make HOCs and put bring functionality into them 
	- x make dataManager and bring all in
		- x all useEffect in
	- x convert all "customers"
	- all pictures in, perhaps with limit
- generize component
- make suppliers site with suppliers and share dataManager and siteManager


// TODO: test bad urls e.g. customers?id=undefined
