- x make HOCs and put bring functionality into them 
	- x make dataManager and bring all in
		- x all useEffect in
	- x convert all "customers"
- x generize component
	- x all pictures in, perhaps with limit

- ,, replace suppliers with products and include 20 with pictures
	- x https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-examples/master/examples/northwind/data/json/products.json
	- x make shell page for products
	- .. show text products
