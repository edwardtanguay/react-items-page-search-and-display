- x bug: bug:  Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.

- ,, make HOCs and put bring functionality into them 
	- ,, make dataManager and bring all in
		- .. all useEffect in
	- make siteManager and bring all in
	- all pictures in, perhaps with limit

- make suppliers site with suppliers and share dataManager and siteManager
